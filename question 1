1. Explain what the simple List component does.
 answer:----
Lists are used to display data in an ordered format and mainly used to display menus on websites. 
In React, Lists can be created in a similar way as we create lists in JavaScript.

1.A single list item is stored inside WrappedSingleListItem 
2.that contains 2 values index and text, 
3.a state named isSelected and an onClick event 
background of a colour chnages accroding to isselected state
const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(true);// if its true it will change it to green
const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(); //Red color

The wrapped list item is then memoized using the memo function, which means that 
react will reuse the list content until the props are same.
Memo function prevents re-rendering on the same element repeatedly.
