2. What problems / warnings is there with code ?
Ans: 
(a) Error in definition of the useState()
set function would be the second parameter.
(b) Error in  WrappedListComponent.propTypes - It should be arrayOf instead of shapeOf.
(c) it will not be mapped beecause in difinition its items are not null.
    WrappedListComponent.defaultProps = {
     items: null,
        };
